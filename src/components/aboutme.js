        <h3>Hello,<br></br><br></br>
My name is Kosay I'm from Syria.<br></br>
When I was a little kid just like any other kid i played football and video games, and here where I discovered my passion for computers.<br></br>
But what I liked the most is drawing and painting, Because it allows me to create beautiful things and opens the door for my imagination.<br></br>
Then I grow up to see the war taking over my country.<br></br>
So I left to Saudi Arabia and worked there in interior decoration.<br></br>
Which I really liked because it has an artistic and creative sides.<br></br>
But I didn't find myself there for my values aren't aligned with the values in Saudi Arabia.<br></br>
But they are in a line with the values here.<br></br>
Thatâ€™s why I came to the Netherland. to have a new start.<br></br>
So the first thing I did was studying Dutch.<br></br>
Then I found an ICT boot camp called "Restart Network" and joined the program.<br></br>
Although it was difficult for me to enter this new world of programing.<br></br>
On the other hand it was very interesting because it allows me to use technology to create new things which affect people's life and can make them happy.<br></br>
Then I did my internship at Deloitte as a part of the program, and there I learned new things and improved my skills in working with a team, plus I got the chance of meeting new people and extending my connection network.<br></br>
Looking back makes me realize how this program changed my life and the way I think.<br></br>
and now after entering the world of technology.<br></br>
I want to keep going forward.<br></br>
To learn more and more.<br></br>
To make products that other people likes and makes a good impact on the society.<br></br>
And most importantly improve myself as a person and as a developer.<br></br><br></br>
Thank you!
